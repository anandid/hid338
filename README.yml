    abstract: >
        In United States, more than 6 million residential homes sold 
        in 2017. With ever-increasing demands, real estate is 
        challenged with complex analysis of homes to 
        provide accurate appraisals and predicting market 
        fluctuations to react accordingly. Big data analytics 
        helps mining the real estate data to provide valuable 
        business insights. In this project, we have planned to 
        analyze housing data to predict sale prices. Using well 
        established datasets, with lots of exploratory variables, 
        we could apply thorough exploration of the data, feature 
        engineering and implement various advanced supervised 
        learning algorithms, such as XGoost, Ridge, Lasso, 
        Random Forest and Neural Network to 
        predict accurate sale prices.
