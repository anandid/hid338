        Apply exploratory data analysis and implement various
        advanced supervised machine learning algorithms to predict
        neighborhood housing sale prices found in the sample test dataset.
        Compare the predicted models and results from these advanced
        supervised algorithms. Apply ensembled model to achieve
        better predictions, hence get good score in kaggle competition.
